# Contributing Guidelines
Thanks for considering contributing to the development of Utilibot.
I just ask that you follow some basic guidelines.

1. Make pull requests to the Dev branch, not Master.
2. Follow the coding style that I use. I won't merge any PRs unless you do.
3. Check the Issues, PRs, and the Dev branch to ensure what you want to
add or open an issue for has not already been addressed.
4. For larger contributions, open an issue first so that it can be discussed.
